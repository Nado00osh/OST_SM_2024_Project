# Intent-Based Energy Reduction Using Stream Mining

As energy consumption rises globally, the need for sustainable and efficient energy management systems becomes increasingly urgent. Conventional energy management systems are often limited by their inability to adapt dynamically to real-time fluctuations in usage and environmental factors. This project leverages stream mining and machine learning techniques to enable real-time adjustments in energy consumption, optimizing resource usage in response to user behavior and environmental conditions.
